Layers:
	Conceptual Design (ex: ER model)
	Schema (ex: Relational model)
	Physical Layer (ex: Files and Indexes)

Relational model
	defines relations and options (data organization and how to query and manipulate data)
	say what you want not what to do
	everything is a relation (data and queries)
	
	relations have attributes (atomic values, which can't be split, ex: month)
		types: string, int, real, date (in Oracle etc), etc
	relations must have keys, which are unique values, that are used to keep tuples from being duplicate
	reordering tuples (rows) does not change the relation
	reordering attributes does not change the relation

	Operations:
		Selection [curly o]
		Projection [pie symbol]
		Cross-product [x]
		Set-difference [-] : tuples in relation 1 but not in 2 (get unique values between the two)
		Union [U]
		Join [sideways hourglass]


Schema of a relation:
	Name of relation and attributes (ex: Person(Name, Address, _SSN_) )
	Types and constraints of attributes

Schema of a database:
	Set of relation schemata
